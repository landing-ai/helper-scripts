    "# Transparent Background to White\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script is designed to iterate through a directory of images, convert them from their original format (with transparency) to a format with a solid background, and then save them as new images with the modified background. It uses the PIL (Pillow) library to handle image manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an image doesn't have transparency, it skips the background conversion part and directly saves it in RGB mode.\n",
    "This script is useful for batch-processing images that need to be converted from formats that support transparency (e.g., PNG) to formats that don't (e.g., JPG)."
